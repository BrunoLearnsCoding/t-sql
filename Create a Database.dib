# How to create a Database

Before creating a database, we should know about collations.

## What is Collation?

**Collation in SQL Server** refers to the rules and settings that govern how data is sorted, compared, and searched within character columns (such as `VARCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`, and `CHAR`). Let's dive into the details:

1. **Purpose of Collation**:
   - **Sorting Order**: Collations determine the order in which characters are sorted. For example, whether uppercase letters come before or after lowercase letters.
   - **Case Sensitivity**: Some collations are case-sensitive (e.g., "A" and "a" are distinct), while others are case-insensitive (e.g., "A" and "a" are treated as the same).
   - **Accent Sensitivity**: Collations can also consider accents (diacritics) when comparing characters (e.g., "√©" vs. "e").

2. **Types of Collations**:
   - **Windows Collations**: These collations follow Windows sorting rules and are suitable for most applications.
   - **SQL Server Collations**: These collations are specific to SQL Server and provide consistent behavior across different platforms.

3. **Where Collations Are Used**:
   - **Database Level**: You can set the default collation for an entire database during its creation.
   - **Table Column Level**: You can specify a collation for individual character columns when creating or altering a table.
   - **Expression Level**: The `COLLATE` clause can be used in expressions to apply collations temporarily.

4. **Inheritance**:
   - If not explicitly specified, databases inherit the default collation of the SQL Server instance.
   - Columns inherit the default collation of the database unless explicitly set.

5. **Example**:
   - Suppose you have a database with the default collation `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` (case-insensitive, accent-sensitive).
   - If you create a table without specifying a collation for a character column, that column will use the default collation of the database.

6. **Changing Collation**:
   - To change the collation of an existing column, use the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `COLLATE` clause.
   - For example:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE MyTable
     ALTER COLUMN MyColumn NVARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN;
     ```
     This changes the collation of `MyColumn` to a binary collation (case-sensitive, accent-sensitive).

Remember that collations impact sorting, searching, and comparison operations. Choose the collation that aligns with your application's requirements. üìäüîç

### How to find out what collations are supported by your SQL server?

#!sql

/* SQL Collations supported by the SQL server */
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations() WHERE name LIKE 'SQL%';

/* Windows Collations supported by the SQL server */
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations() WHERE [name] NOT LIKE N'SQL%';

### Create a Databse with persian collation

#!sql

/* The collation is 'Case Insensetive', 'Accent Insensetive' and supports 'Supplamentary Characters' and UTF8 */

CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName COLLATE Persian_100_CI_AI_SC_UTF8;
